## About 🤔:

This is a project made for Logic Programming subject at SENAI CIMATEC, it's a console-based matrix game: Simulates a large battle in Lapland, where players position their soldiers represented by 1 and 2, # or @ on a matrix grid.

## Resourses 🧑‍🔬:

- Soldier placement: Players can position their troops on the battlefield during the setup phase.

- Soldier types: Players can choose between four types of soldiers: 

Type "1" soldiers can only shoot forward, stopping at the 
first enemy encountered.

Type "2" soldiers can only shoot diagonally.

South Special soldier "@": The @ soldier can fire a 3x3 bomb anywhere on the field, eliminating all enemy soldiers within the affected area.

North Special soldier "#": The # soldier can shoot in a straight line, eliminating all enemies in its path.

- Battle between north and south: After troop placement, the battle commences between the north and south sides of Lapland, the goal is to eliminate the enemy soldiers before losing all of your own troops.

- Interface that allows players to position soldiers, and execute attacks.

- Text visual feedback: The game provides visual feedback during the battle, indicating the movements and attacks performed by the soldiers, enabling players to track the progress of the battle with victory/defeat messages

- Game restart: Players have the option to restart the game and play again.
